# 🧠 Projects-CPP

A curated collection of C++ projects and programs built during my academic journey, self-learning, and placement preparation. This repository showcases my hands-on skills in problem-solving, object-oriented programming (OOP), and implementation of core data structures and algorithms.

---

## 🚀 Objectives

- Strengthen C++ programming skills through hands-on implementation.
- Build a portfolio of well-structured, readable, and efficient code.
- Prepare for technical interviews and coding assessments.
- Apply theoretical concepts to real-world problem-solving.
